--Bayesian Networks--

Model to make predictions
Probability distribution P(X|a)

Bayes Rule

Basics
  Structured representation
  Conditional independence
  Naive Bayes model
  Independence facts

Nodes in graphs connected by arrows
  No loops
  Variables with arrows
    Variable with no entering arrow
      Assigned by marginal prob
    Variable with entering arrow
      Conditional distribution given entering node(s)
      P(C|x) where x is from the entering node(s)

      Say S leads into C
      P(C,S) = P(C|S)P(S)
      Marginalization: row and column sums

    P(S|C) = (P(C|S)P(S))/P(C) = P(C,S)/P(C)

  Extended to larger networks with multiple nodes

  Independent variables: nodes with no entering arrows
    Say A, G for age and gender
    P(A,G) = P(G)P(A)

  Say A and G lead into S, then S leads into C (for Smoking and Cancer)
    Causal chain
    Simplification of dependence

Reduces size of necessary sample to get a reasonable estimate
